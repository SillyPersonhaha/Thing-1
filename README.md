TSB Saitama script that just changes your animations. There is only 1 thing that could be seen as an "Advantage", and that's just a run tool. Things that are changed/added with this script are:

- Normal Punch animation
- Shove animation
- Uppercut animation
- Uppercut velocity removed
- Death counter animation and sounds are changed
- Serious Punch animation and sounds are changed
- (NEW) Run Tool (W.I.P, some bugs)
- W.I.P Serious Punch Anim Rework

I MAY add more stuff in the future if I can think of stuff to change. This is a passion project to help me learn roblox scripting for funsies :)

This is also NOT obfuscated so people can learn how to do stuff like I did. (If anyone else finds this)
